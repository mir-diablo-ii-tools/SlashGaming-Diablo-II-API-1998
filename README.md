# SlashGaming Diablo II Modding API, 1998 (SGD2MAPI98)
SlashGaming Diablo II Modding API is a code edit modding API for Diablo II.

## Goal
The goal of SGD2MAPI98 is to act as a library linked to by code edit mods for Diablo II and Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. It incorporates commonly used Diablo II code edit definitions into a single library. It also features a simple development API for patch writing, and version detection for supporting multiple versions from one DLL file. The project is intended to target Visual Studio C++ 6.0 (VC6) and C89.

The project is also a successor to the original [SGD2MAPI](https://github.com/mir-diablo-ii-tools/SlashGaming-Diablo-II-API) project. This project began as an experiment to rewrite the code in C89, targeting a compiler from 1998. Due to this project's significantly smaller footprint, it has become the main project.
